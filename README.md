# Guidelines
## Git 
### Workflow
The work on this project should happen via `feature-branches`
   
Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. 
When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. 
The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, 
but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).
   
1) Create a new `feature/feature-name` or `fix/bug-fix-name` branch from master
2) Push all your changes to that branch
3) Create a Pull Request to merge that branch into `master`

## Best Practise
- Do not use Console.WriteLine etc, use the specially designed logger.
- Own the Code: extract solutions, discard libraries.
- Annotate functions with documentation comments (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments).
